“_Farol_” and “_Adios Arrabal_” take up a huge chunk of tango territory. They cover the two great themes of tango: nostalgia, and the _arrabal_.
These are interesting subjects because, like most things in tango, they're made up of contradictory elements.

Today, the average _porteño_ probably has mixed feelings about the neighborhoods of his youth -- which is the subject of “_Adios Arrabal_”.
Vargas’ lyrics flirt with anger, affection, and contempt all at the same time.
The first word of this tango is “_mañanita_”.
This is a diminutive form of “_mañana_” (morning), and it literally means “little morning”, or "early in the morning" ... but in Spanish, the diminutive can also be a term of affection.
So _“madre_” becomes “_madrecita_”, and “_vieja_” become “_viejita_”.
The visitor in “_Adios Arrabal_” has returned to his neighborhood to say goodbye.
He begins nostalgically ... “Sweet morning in the _arrabal_”, but his memories are mixed.
The people are beautiful, but they are also tough, and difficult.
He says he felt like he was a slave, but also a master.
He is bitter and angry, but also proud (“_envenena’o_” means “full of venom”).
So, he despises the _arrabal_, but he also misses it ... to the point where he actually apologizes for having silly, sentimental feelings stuck in his head that “no one can change.”

“_Mañanita arrabalera_ ...” A sweet Sunday morning in _Barracas_.

A couple of notes: I think maybe the “_madrecita_” he talks to in the middle part could actually represent the _arrabal_ itself.
But Alej and my _profesora_ think that he really is talking to his mother, because a close relationship with mom and family is a characteristic of _machismo arrabalero_.
It makes sense either way.
So like "_mañanita_", which could mean either "early morning", or "sweet morning", "_madrecita_" adds a bit of ambiguity.
Which is the art of it.

The Buenos Aires street word “_espiantarse_” turns up again.
I translated it as “slips away” two pages back (“How life slips away”).
Here it is used to describe the singer’s old friends who have “fled” the _arrabal_.
I checked a little further, and found that it’s not in common usage that much, but most people are familiar with it.
Like a lot of language, it tells us a about the people and the culture.
It’s a variation of an Italian word, and they use it specifically to describe escaping from the cops, the way a criminal runs away.
Sort of makes sense that a specialized word like that would pop up among the poor Italian immigrants in turn of the century BsAs.

Tangos like “_Farol_” and “_Adios Arrabal_” offer insights into the soul of Argentina, and also of tango itself.
While the raucous old neighborhoods did contain a lot of knife-wielding characters, they also seemed to inspire people.
Writers, poets, musicians and dancers seemed to thrive there, and the tradition of working class artists that exists today in Buenos Aires has roots in the _arrabal_.
The city is full of taxi drivers who write poetry, and construction workers who play music.
A couple of weeks ago the orchestra from _Teatro Colon_ staged a free outdoor concert in _Parque Palermo_ for people who could never afford to go to the theater.
In many cities an orchestra playing classical music in the park wouldn’t have been any big deal, but Buenos Aires is different.
More than 100,000 people showed up, and it brought our part of town to a standstill.

_"Cortada El Farol”_ by _Sra._ Estela Di Paola. When the mother of my _profesora_
heard that I was working on “_Farol_”, she painted this picture.
Note that the light of the farol only illuminates a part
of the _cortada_ -- the short, dead-end street.

Last week our water heater began acting up -- on a Friday afternoon of course.
I happened to grab a plumber down the block who was just leaving for the weekend.
He was a very tough looking man, and he had a young assistant who was pierced, tattooed, and dirty -- the kind of guys you watch out for on the streets late at night.
I talked them into coming over to check the water heater.
Alej was a little upset that I invited them into the house, because they really did look dangerous, but they were able to fix the heater in about ten minutes, and when they finished, the plumber asked me if I had bought the house.
I said yep, and he said, well you bought it from the sister of Maximiliano Guerra (which is true).
His assistant said, ahh, but I think Julio Bocca is better than Guerra ... and then they began to discuss the relative merits of the two most famous ballet dancers in Argentina.
(And they also refused to accept any payment for fixing the heater).
I love this place.

In December of 2007, Julio Boca danced on a stage set up in front of the _Obelisco_. It was a free performance
for the people who couldn't afford a ticket to _Teatro Colon_ ... and half a million people showed up!
Where else but Buenos Aires?
