# _"Idilio Trunco"_
**"End of the Affair"**

This is one of the greatest of the great Castillo _valses_. I remember some milongueros singing along with it at a party a few years ago, and Miguel Balbi, who sings tango in clubs, kept repeating the last line: _"No hay NADA entre nosotros ... ANDATE por favor!"_

They were trying to match the sharpness and emotion of Castillo's voice, and they kept shaking their heads and laughing at how difficult it was.
The words are about a man who has absolutely reached his limit with a woman.
He doesn't pull any punches, and his message is clear:
"I'm finished with you ... understand? I'm sick of your games.
You've hurt me for the last time, so ... _get out of here!!"_

Ernesto Delgado and Miguelito kept marveling at the difficulty of staying with Castillo, and also chuckling at the half funny, half tragic lyrics. I mean, it is tragic --
but then, most of us have been there -- and we lived through it.
So from the distance of a few years, it's possible to see a touch of humor in the way Castillo hammers out that last line:

**_IDILIO TRUNCO,_ Balcarce con Castillo**

> _Can't you see my pain?
> Everything is finished.
> There's nothing between us ...
> so please ... just get out of here!_
>
> _Andate ...
> no vengas con tus súplicas
> a recordar las horas

>
> _Que sólo has de encontrar aquí
> las ruinas de un amor
> que fue la dicha más feliz
> que yo por vos acaricié._
>
> _No vuelvas.
> Tus ruegos y tus lágrimas
> no han de borrar de mi alma
> tu acción que ha sido pérfida._
>
> _Te puedo perdonar el mal
> que halle de tu traición en vos,
> pero no olvidarás, mujer,
> que he muerto para vos._
>
> _¿A qué has venido?
> ¿No ves que estoy enfermo
> de tanto haber sufrido
> por culpa de tu amor?_
>
> _¿No ves se va mi pena?
> Ya todo ha terminado.
> No hay nada entre nosotros ...
> ¡Andate, por favor!_

_"Andate"_ is a strong word in _castellano_.
In Argentina, you would normally say, "_Deberías irte"_ ("You should go")_. Andate_ is like saying, _"Beat it!"_ or _"Hit the road!"_
It's something you might yell at a dog trespassing in your yard.

Like all the great tango singers, Castillo is also an actor.
He begins relatively calmly, but as he tells his story, he begins to get worked up.
The "_Andate_" at the beginning is noticeably different from the one at the end, as he moves from indignation, into something approaching rage.
I really love the energy and passion in this _vals._
Castillo is a fantastic singer.
We know a good milonguero (Gerardo Quiroz) who will only dance to _valses_ if they're sung by Castillo.

After watching Miguel and Ernesto, I've tried to sing along with Castillo and Echagüe to some of the fast tangos.
I'm neither a singer, nor a native speaker, so it's just for fun -- but it's still an interesting exercise.
If you try it, you'll get some idea of how difficult it is to sing tango.
I'm not able to make may mouth move fast enough to keep up with the music, and Castillo's cadences are very complicated.
I still can't figure out how he manages to squeeze in all the words at the end of this _vals_ and still finish with the orchestra.

For me, great _valses_ like this one are at the very pinnacle of tango dancing.
Listen to the totality of the music, and the way Castillo's voice soars and plays around the cadence.
This one has about 80 strong beats per minute, with two weak beats squeezed in between.
It's super fast, but it’s not _staccato_ (it doesn’t have a lot of sharp, distinct notes).
Like most of the best _valses_, the cadence is fast and clear, but everything still flows forward smoothly ...
so there’s really only one way to express it:
Your body needs to keep moving and turning, while your feet express the _compás_ by hitting some of the very fast weak beats.

We'll discuss this a lot more and give examples in Chapters 5 & 6, but for now, the thing to remember is that the “park and perform” tango they sell in workshops has nothing to do with this music.
This _vals_ is a round hole -- and stunts like _volcadas_ and _sacadas_ are square pegs.
They won't fit.
