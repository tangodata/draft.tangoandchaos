# _"Pensalo Bien"_

**"Think Carefully"**

Can you identify the orchestra?
For me, there are two clues.
The first is the sharp, unique sound of the piano, which points to Biaggi.
But if you listen to the old-fashioned, wavering violin (about 50 seconds in), you’ll find another hint.
This is my personal way of quickly identifying D’Arienzo. He put the sound into some of his best tangos from the 1930s (when Biaggi was with him). As far as the singer, I’m a little embarrassed to say I didn’t recognize Echagüe at first.
I guess I’m more used to his snarling tough-guy sound in _El Nene del Abasto_ ("The Kid from Abasto") and _Cartón Junado_ ("Well-Known Hoodlum"), instead of the pensive, “give me another chance” voice he uses here:

> _Think carefully
> before taking this step ...
> because tomorrow,
> you may not be able to step back._
>
> _Think carefully ...
> because I have loved you so much.
> And now, you have thrown it away ...
> perhaps for another love._
>
> _Pensalo bien
> antes de dar ese paso...
> que tal vez mañana acaso
> no puedas retroceder_.
>
> _Pensalo bien ...
> ya que tanto te he querido.
> Y lo has echado al olvido ...
> tal vez por otro querer._

Nice! This is a great example one of the most interesting things in tango: Contradiction.
The story is sad, but the music has an almost cheerful energy that can fool you.
Obviously, you need to understand the lyrics in order to dance to it the right way -- but there's more than that.
Somehow, this combination of upbeat music and sad words, sung in Echagüe's hard, _arrabal_ voice, makes the message even more poignant.

## Music Identification Tip: D'Arienzo

The easiest way to identify D’Arienzo’s music from the mid-thirties is to listen for the bright sound of Biaggi’s piano, and that distinctive, wavering violin.
We've already heard D’Arienzo use it to accent the music in _Pensalo Bien_, and _El Cencerro._ I think the way he uses it to offset the relentless bandoneon _compás_ of _Cencerro_ raises an average tango to the level of a masterpiece (at least for dancers).

This tango isn't a _Cencerro_, but it's still a very nice one that provides a clear example of Biaggi’s bright piano, and it also has that unforgettable violin, with D'Arienzo's bandoneons _chunking_ away in the background.
I included a few lines of Hector Mauré’s voice at the end (we’ll listen to him more later):

Once your ear learns the old-fashioned sound of this violin and Biaggi's piano, you shouldn’t have any trouble identifying the D’Arienzo-Biaggi tangos ... but the lyrics can fool you.
Up until today, I thought _Tierrita_ was about something nice.
Mauré's voice sounds friendly enough, and _Tierrita_ normally means "a nice little bit of land", so I figured he was probably singing about somebody's garden in Buenos Aires.
But when I translated it, I found the _tierrita_ in this tango actually refers to the selfishness inside the head of a young woman.
And now that I know what the tango is about, I suddenly hear Mauré's words dripping with sarcasm instead of friendliness.
We'll translate a few lines, but instead of using the unpleasant literal translation of "dirt in the head", I'll use "vain illusions":

> _Why keep lying?
> Go and look for someone, my little girl,
> who can remove the vain illusions
> you have inside your head ..._
>
> _Para qué seguir mintiendo?
> Andá y buscate, mi hijita,
> quién te saque la tierrita
> que tenés en la cabeza ..._

_Porteños_ love shrinks.
BsAs has the highest ratio of psychiatrists to patients in the world, and it's funny that even in this very _barrio_, 70-year-old tango, this man is telling the girl she's a head-case, and needs psychiatric help!
We're rolling with D'Arienzo, so let's do one more.
On the next page we'll listen to how he and Mauré sounded ten years later.
