<h2 id="beauty-in-motion">Beauty in Motion</h2>

<p>For years, Alejandra and I had heard rumors of a reclusive milonguera named Teta, whose grace and skill on the dance floor were said to be matched only by her beauty. But I was never able to capture her on film, because she was very shy, and almost never appeared in milongas. Then a few years ago, Alej was able to track down a rare piece of video of this legendary beauty. It cost a small fortune, but after I looked at it, I realized it was worth every penny – because it gives a brief glimpse of possibly the most amazing tango dancer of all time. I think every woman who dances tango can go to school on this film. Not only is it a clinic on how to dress and use the <em>cabeceo</em>, but her <em>ochos</em> and <em>volcadas</em> are the best in the business.</p>

<p>Here’s the incomparable Teta:</p>

<p>The rumors are true: Teta is as talented as she is beautiful!</p>
